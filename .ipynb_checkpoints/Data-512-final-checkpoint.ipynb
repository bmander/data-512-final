    "We are in the midst of a pandemic and considering that this class is \"human centered data science\", I thought to find a reliable source of covid related dataset and analyse it. I am specifically interested to see how death related to COVID-19 is affecting people of color using this data. There are other interesting questions that can be answered with thid dataset. The results could be informative for public health practices. I want to learn more about how this disease affecting people with different demographics. \n",

I tried to find a data source that is interesting, related to human, and results can be meaningful and applicable to the current situation. However, I also tried to keep in mind that it should be something that is doable in the timeline of this class. I have not started working with the data yet but I think it should be doable.  "
